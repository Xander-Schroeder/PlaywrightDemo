## Phase 1: Project Structure Setup

1. **Create Playwright Test Structure**: Set up the following directory structure directly in the project root:

```console
tests/
├── e2e/                    # End-to-end test files
├── page-objects/           # Page Object Model classes
├── utils/                  # Utilities and helpers
└── test-data/              # Test data files
```

2. **Essential Configuration Files**:
   - `playwright.config.ts` - Cross-browser configuration with projects for chromium, firefox, webkit, Mobile Chrome, Mobile Safari
   - Global setup/teardown for test environment management
   - Proper timeout configurations (60s test timeout, 10s expect timeout)
   - Any package.lock files or other project files that are needed to be able to run these tests
