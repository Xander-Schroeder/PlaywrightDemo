## Phase 5: Check success

1. **Check all tests**
    - Run these tests and confirm they all pass
    - Confirm they run in less than five minutes as well
    - If they do not all pass observe the errors and compare with your acceptance criteria in 'Master_Test_Sheet_DIS_3.2.csv' and fix any tests that need to be fixed

2. **ADDITIONAL SUCCESS CRITERIA**
    Test Implementation Completeness:
        - [ ] **Basic infrastructure**: Dedicated file that explore basic infrastructure of the site
        - [ ] **Panels**: Dedicated test file with Creation, Configuration, Control, Deletion (refer to criteria in  `Master_Test_Sheet_DIS_3.2.csv`)
        - [ ] **Readers**: Dedicated test file with Creation, Configuration, Control, Badge Testing, Events, Alarms, Deletion (refer to criteria in  `Master_Test_Sheet_DIS_3.2.csv`)

3. **MANDATORY COMPLETION CRITERIA**
    - **Must achieve 100% pass rate** - no failing tests allowed
    - **Reader tests MUST match CSV exactly** - each CSV row should have corresponding test
    - **All 7 reader test categories required**: Creation, Configuration, Control, Badge Testing, Event Configuration, Alarms, Deletion
    - **Navigation must work reliably** - no timeout errors on basic page access
    - **Use MCP browser to verify each test step** before implementing the test

4. **DO NOT STOP UNTIL ALL REQUIREMENTS MET**
    - Keep iterating and fixing issues until ALL tests pass
    - Each failure must be debugged using MCP browser exploration
    - Reference the indicators.md file for correct selectors and navigation paths
    - Validate every selector and interaction pattern in the browser before coding
